# ðŸ§¾ Toast System Feature Checklist

This document outlines the **implemented**, **pending**, and **advanced (nice-to-have)** features for the toast notification system.

---

## âœ… Must-Haves (All Implemented)

- [x] `ToastProvider` to manage global toast state
- [x] `useToast` hook to expose `addToast` and `removeToast`
- [x] `ToastContainer` rendered via `createPortal` to `document.body`
- [x] Multiple toasts stack correctly in bottom-right
- [x] Each toast auto-dismisses after `duration` ms
- [x] Manual dismiss (`x` button) works per-toast
- [x] `role="alert"` added for accessibility
- [x] Clean `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` on mount/unmount
- [x] `createdAt + duration` logic ensures FIFO dismissal order

---

## ðŸŸ¡ Good-to-Haves (Pending)

- [ ] Enforce `maxSnackBar` limit (remove oldest toast if limit is reached)
- [ ] `renderToast?: (toast) => JSX.Element` for custom content
- [ ] Position config (`top-left`, `bottom-left`, etc.)
- [ ] Pause auto-dismiss on hover
- [ ] Show Progress bar at bottom of each toast
- [x] Type-based styling (success, error, default)

---

## ðŸ”µ Great-to-Implement (Advanced Enhancements)

- [ ] Add entry/exit animations using `framer-motion` or `react-transition-group`
- [ ] Add queueing logic for overflow (if `maxSnackBar` is enforced)
- [ ] Add support for `rtl`-aware positioning
- [ ] `aria-live="assertive"` region for screen readers (currently covered by `role="alert"`)
- [ ] Add unit tests for:
  - `useToast` behavior
  - Auto-dismiss logic
  - Manual dismissal
  - Max limit enforcement

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The system correctly handles **staggered auto-dismissals** thanks to the `createdAt + duration` tracking.
- Current toast rendering order is correct (`.reverse()` in `ToastContainer`).
- Styling is minimal but functional; future animation + theme tokens could be layered in.
